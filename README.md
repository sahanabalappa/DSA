# Data Structure Using Java 
## *Motivation:  
### "How can we a better coder if we dont know how good our code is?"
##### *Foundation To Data Structure
###### Data Structure: Is the way of organizing the data In memory

#### Types Of Data Structure
##### 1.Linked List: Music Player.
##### 2.Stacks: Recently opened web pages in web browser.
##### 3.Queues: Job scheduling in OS.
##### 4.Trees: Folder Structure in Os.
##### 5.Graphs: Google maps.
##### 6.Trie: Red lines in Editor.

There  are different ways to achieve something.like you want to travel from one place to another,you can do that using different way,like you take a flight,train,bus,car or u can walk
Every approach as its own pros and cons.like taking flight is faster but  not cost efficient and this may not applicable every time.you cannot take a filght to next street

#### How to compare the algorithms?
###### Alogithm camparision should be independent of programming languages and external factors like hardware.Idea way to compare algorithm is to compare its growth rate.
Ex. we need to send a file to your friend .How can you do this
###### 1.By sending an email via email or FTP
###### 2.By taking that file in the harddrive and by travelling by yourself to your friend location and handling it over 
In case 2 the time would be constant irrespective of the file size the travel time taken is same.hence it represents constant time complexity O(1).
In case 1 if its small.it is send over internet with no time,large  it takes more time
##### Types of Analysis
###### 1.Best Case: minimum time taken for program execution(Big-Omega)
###### 2.
